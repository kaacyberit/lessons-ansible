[1mNAME[0m
       ansible-galaxy - Perform various Role and Collection related operations.

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       usage: ansible-galaxy [-h] [--version] [-v] TYPE ...

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Command to manage Ansible roles and collections.

       None  of  the  CLI tools are designed to run concurrently with themselves.  Use an external scheduler
       and/or locking to ensure there are no clashing operations.

[1mCOMMON OPTIONS[0m
       [1m--version[0m
          show program's version number, config file location, configured module search path,  module  loca‚Äê
          tion, executable location and exit

       [1m-h[22m, [1m--help[0m
          show this help message and exit

       [1m-v[22m, [1m--verbose[0m
          Causes  Ansible  to print more debug messages. Adding multiple -v will increase the verbosity, the
          builtin plugins currently evaluate up to -vvvvvv. A reasonable level to start is -vvv,  connection
          debugging might require -vvvv. This argument may be specified multiple times.
